Hi family, you all should have received an email that we’re moving our “in-person” reunion date to an online only event.

- August 1, 2020 from Noon-1:30 – call in anytime via Zoom, and we’ll check in with each family to see how everyone’s surviving this challenging COVID-19 impacted year.

- Questions? Email Suzy/Dean Chandler (suzannechandler@comcast.net) or Mart/Loraine Chandler lmchandlere@comcast.net (yes, there’s an “e” at the end of her email address)

- Didn’t get an email? Email Suzy to be updated on the email list.
(we sent emails on January 31st and June 19th)

- Zoom info (we’ll send this out to all family email addresses we have):
